Re-creating the chart here and extending the analysis further:

https://robertkelchen.com/2020/06/01/how-much-do-private-colleges-rely-on-auxiliary-revenue-sources/

TO DO:
*  Kelchen uses Sector but does not differentiate further by Carnegie class. Get IPEDS institutional characteristics data file and look at Carnegie classes. In particular, how do lib arts schools look as a group? 
*  Further examine schools with 0 aux revenues. Yale is one example where they clearly have room & board,etc. but must be reporting these earnings elsewhere.
*  Other interesting ways to look at this? For example, if aux revenue goes to almost 0 in Fall 2020 b/c of Covid, how do other aspects of institutions finances look in terms of compensating? How much endowment do they have?
*  Consider adding international student % and commuter % to analysis
